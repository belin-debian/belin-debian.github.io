Description: Common Lisp interface to Speech Dispatcher
 Speech Dispatcher provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis.
 It supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as
 backends and provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and
 playing back PCM data via those different backends to applications.
 .
 Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech and
 application specific user configurations are implemented in a device
 independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from
 having to yet again reinvent the wheel.
 .
 This package contains a Common Lisp library for communication with Speech
 Dispatcher.

Description: Multi-lingual software speech synthesizer
 eSpeak NG is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other
 languages.
 .
 This package contains compatibility links that makes it a drop-in replacement
 for the espeak package.  Installing this package thus allows one to make
 applications calling the /usr/bin/espeak program use eSpeak NG without any
 modification or rebuild.

Description: Scriptable screen reader
 A flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive technology that
 provides end-user access to applications and toolkits that support the
 AT-SPI (e.g., the GNOME desktop).
 .
 Orca defines a set of default behaviors (reactions to application events) and
 key bindings (reaction to user key presses). These default behaviors and key
 bindings can be overwritten on a per-application basis. Orca creates a script
 object for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
 and key bindings, and the application specific ones. Orca provides the
 infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a host of
 services accessible from within the scripts.
